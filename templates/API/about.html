<p class="my-2">The diversityorgs.tech API is designed with two missions:</p>

<ui>
    <li>Provide Easy Access for Admins to update organizations</li>
    <li>Allow organizations and other sites the ability to use our organization lists on their pages as it makes sense.</li>
</ui>

<p class="my-2">DiversityOrgs.Tech was designed not to be the final stop on your journey in discovering community.
    Also, for many people this site won't be the first either.</p>

<p class="my-2">As an aggregator, the goal of this site is to make it easier for people to find organizaitons they believe focus on them.</p>
